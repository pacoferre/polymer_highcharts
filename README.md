# polymer_highcharts
Polymer 1.0 element for http://www.highcharts.com/

You have to download and copy libraries to /js folder. Fix highcharts-import.html to correct folder if not.

HighCharts

JQuery

Also, this element must be in the same folder (bower_components) as Polymer. The same, fix highcharts-element.html.


For this example, i took code from:
http://www.highcharts.com/demo/gauge-solid

Default demo and put it into _createContext function.

Changed same properties and voila. You could do the same for all other HighCharts demos.
